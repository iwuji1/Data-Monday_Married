# Data-Monday_Married

Hey y'all this was a project from the data monday site.

This week's challenge was to vizulaize this data comparing marriage rates across genders and years

I used the chance to try making a chart type I've always wanted to try, the mirrored barchart

It took a lot longer than expected! But it looks alright!

I used node to run this, so a note to self to start the project you want to type in the command line:

"npm start"
